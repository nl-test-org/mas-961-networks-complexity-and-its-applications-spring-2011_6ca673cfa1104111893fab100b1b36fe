Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Summary
-------

Complex systems, such as the cell, cities or the economy, are formed by heterogeneous collections of components and interactions. During recent years the science of networks emerged as an alternative approach to analyze the structure and evolution of complex systems. In this course, we introduce the basic concepts and applications of network science for a general audience. The course will cover:

*   Basic network models;
*   A wide array of statistics used to characterize the structure and dynamics of networks;
*   Examples of naturally occurring networks in biology, technology, and social systems, including social networks and economic networks; and
*   Theories and applications of networks and complexity science that can be used to explain and understand the structure of the studied systems.

Evaluation
----------

Students will be evaluated through homework, presentations, class participation and by the questions students ask the invited speakers.
